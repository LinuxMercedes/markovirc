# List of channels to join on start.
# Current flags are -speak, silent, -commands, hilight. -speak disables
# speaking randomly in that channel, while the -commands flag disables commands. silent
# implies both -speak and -commands. Hilight is on by default with no flags, but is disabled
# by -speak. It enables marko to only respond to highlights if combined with silent or -speak.
