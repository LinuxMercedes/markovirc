==== markovirc =========

Markovirc or Marko is an IRC bot deeply inspired by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/seeborg/">seeborg</a>. Although knowledge of how seeborg worked at its core was unknown while developing the majority markovirc, 
code was written that nearly mirrors seeborg's. Markovirc was created with the intention to improve some of the major downfalls that seeborg had.
