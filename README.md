Markovirc
=============

Markovirc is an IRC bot in Ruby that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chains</a> to generate text which appears human written. It gathers its source text from any channel it sits in, leading to humerous messages or drivel. Markovirc is an IRC bot deeply inspired by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/seeborg/">seeborg</a>.
