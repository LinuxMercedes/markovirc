speakRandom

Wraps speak() going from someone's last spoken line. It'll only go through if a random probability is met,
and in the future may get thrown out for various criteria described in the example config file. It somewhat
randomly chooses a word from the text provided by ranking all words by their frequency of occurance and choosing
randomly from top rarest 45%**. This knocks out a bunch of pronouns and common verbs, which are typically boring... 
this is also incredibly rough for the internet, as grammar gets the axe online.
